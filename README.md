This is the github for the manuscript titled: Clearing the air on pollutant disruptions of the gut-brain axis: Developmental exposure to Benzo[a]pyrene disturbs zebrafish behavior and the gut microbiome in adults and subsequent generations. 

This set of files documents all code used to analyze the data in the paper:

- documentation of preprocessing code for metagenome and 16S sequences is in the directory preprocessing sequence scripts and code
- all input files referenced in R markdowns is in input_files_pub
- scripts is a directory of custom scripts used for some particular analyses and figures, referenced in the R markdowns
- zfBaP_16Sdiversity_analysis* files are related to 16S analysis and graphs
- zfBaP_PubAnalysis* files are related to metagenomic analysis and graphs
- zfBaP_behavior* files are related to the fish behavior analysis and graphs
- zfBaP_microviz is related to the differential abundance analysis and graphs

The .md (markdown) files and/or .Rmd (R markdown) files are the most useful for reading through our code and approach to analysis.
